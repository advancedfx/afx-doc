# About

HLAE Cam Importer (short: hlaecamimporter)
is a script for autodesk's 3D Studio Max to import HLAE's camera motion data from the BVH Cam File.

With camera motion data in 3ds you can easily produce 3D Elements or render special layers for a better post production.

The plugin is written in Max Script.
It is developed and maintained by msthavoc


Just use MaxScript to run the script. If you have the 90Â° fix selected, the importer will loop the timeline 2 times.
