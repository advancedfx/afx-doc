# mirv_gameoverlay

<tt>mirv_gameoverlay enable _0|1_</tt>

* **0**: disable
* **1**: enable (will only work if it was enabled initially)

Command that allows to disable / enable the Steam overlay in-game.
This command may be useful if you record with startmovie, as recording with mirv_streams ignore the overlay by default already.
Please note that this will not disable Steam notification sounds, but those are not recorded by startmovie anyway.
