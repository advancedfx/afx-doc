<tt>mirv_movie_export_sound _**0**|1_</tt>

* **Default:** 0

If enabled then MDT will create an 22.025 kHz 16 Bit Stereo .wav (RIFF) audio file (original Half-Life quality). If there should be problems we recommend turning s_eax and s_a3d off (set them to 0).
With mirv_sound_volume you can control the clamping of the sound before it is outputted.
