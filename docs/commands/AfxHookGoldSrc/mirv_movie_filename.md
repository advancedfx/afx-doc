# mirv_movie_filename

<tt>mirv_movie_filename &quot;_a name or folder path_&quot;</tt>

* **Default:** "untitled"

Filename to use when dumping movies. Filenames are also automatically labelled with a 'take' number that increments every time you start filming with the same filename.
Tip: Since you can also specify windows paths in front of the filename here (make sure you use the quotation marks then), you can use this to dump to a specific directory or even network drive you have assigned a drive letter to :)
