# mirv_depth_exr

<tt>mirv_depth_exr _0_|_1_|_2_</tt>

Allows exporting depth images with 23-bit precision depth to OpenEXR format.

; 0: **default** / old
; 1: OpenEXR
; 2: Compressed OpenEXR (slower but smaller than 1)

The image has header stored correctly as far as we know, but it might still appear mirrored up-side-down in several programs
