<tt>__mirv_fixforcehltv 0|**1**</tt>

* **0 :** disabled
* **1 :** enabled (default)

**There is usually no need to change this setting**: entering of dem_forcehltv auto-detected and the fix behaves accordingly.

When using the dem_forcehltv 1 with in-eye demos, Half-Life usually won't draw the player that recorded it in 3rd person. The fix tells Half-Life to draw this player too.

Please note that in-eye demos usually don't contain data about players that are far &quot;out of sight&quot; - we are sorry, but this fix can't change that, it only fixes the guy that recorded the demo.
