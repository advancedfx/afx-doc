# mirv_cameraofs_cs

```
mirv_cameraofs_cs <fRight> <fUp> <fForward> [<fPitch> <fYaw> <fRoll>]
```

This should work in most Half-Life (1) mods. Can be used to move the final view right up or forward. For example <tt>mirv_cameraofs_cs 1.5 0 -10</tt> would move the view 1.5 units to the right and 10 units backwards.
