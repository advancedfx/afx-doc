# mirv_fx_wh_xtendvis

<tt>mirv_fx_wh_xtendvis _0|**1**_</tt>

* **Default:** 1

When enabled, this forces Half-Life to ignore the visibility checks.
This means you can see all walls and this is especially helpfull for HLTV demos, because in those you can see the CTs at their spawn from the T spawn on de_dust2 and so on.
(The use for in-eye demos is limited. So in case the wh shows too much walls, then set it to 0, so you will
have the default H-L vis check enabled again)

**Recording has to be started and you need to move around a bit**, before the changes take effect.
