# mirv_gameoverlay

<tt>mirv_gameoverlay enable _0|1_</tt>

* **0**: disable
* **1**: enable (will only work if it was enabled initially)

Command for lazy people (you know who you are) that allows to disable / enable the gameoverlay.
This command is probably not useful in AfxHookGoldSrc, since the gameoverlay will not be recorded by HLAE anyway probably.
Please note that this will not disable Steam notification sounds, but those are not recorded by HLAE anyway.

Basically I don't know why I added this to GoldSrc too.
