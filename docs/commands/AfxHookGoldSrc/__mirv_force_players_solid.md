# __mirv_force_players_solid

<tt>__mirv_force_players_solid **0**|1</tt>

* **Default**: 0

Set to 1 if you have HLTV recordings on KZ maps with Kreetz plugins that force the players to be not solid. Setting to 1 allows them to be spectated normally (which would not work otherwise). Might allow to spectate dead players lol.
