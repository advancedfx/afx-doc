# -mirv_recordmovie

```
+mirv_recordmovie
-mirv_recordmovie
```

Pressing the key will trigger [[mirv_recordmovie_start|GoldSrc:mirv_recordmovie_start]].

Releasing the key will trigger [[mirv_recordmovie_stop|GoldSrc:mirv_recordmovie_stop]].


**Important notice for Team Fortress Classic mod (TFC) users:**<br />
You may want to avoid binding toggles in TFC, because when resuming into the game
it will call the key release event in case you bound the toggle to any key.<br />
We suggest binding the non-toggling versions linked above instead.
